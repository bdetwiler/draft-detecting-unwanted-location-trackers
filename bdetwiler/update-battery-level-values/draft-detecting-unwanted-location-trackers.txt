                  Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers
           draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers-latest

Abstract

   This document lists a set of best practices and protocols for
   accessory manufacturers whose products have built-in location-
   tracking capabilities.  By following these requirements and
   recommendations, a location-tracking accessory will be compatible
   with unwanted tracking detection and alerts on mobile platforms.
   This is an important capability for improving the privacy and safety
   of individuals in the circumstance that those accessories are used to
   track their location without their knowledge or consent.

1.  Introduction

   This document’s goal is to, in part, help protect the privacy of
   individuals from unwanted tracking by location-tracking accessories.
   Location-tracking accessories provide numerous benefits to consumers,
   but, as with all technology, it is possible for them to be misused.
   Misuse of location-tracking accessories can result in unwanted
   tracking of individuals or items for nefarious purposes such as
   stalking, harassment, and theft.  This document is focused on
   protecting people from misuse of location-tracking accessories.
   Formalizing a set of best practices for manufacturers will allow for
   scalable compatibility with unwanted tracking detection technologies
   on various smartphone platforms and improve privacy and security for
   individuals.

   Unwanted tracking detection can both detect and alert individuals
   that a location tracker separated from the owner's device is
   traveling with them, as well as provide means to find and disable the
   tracker.  This document outlines technical best practices for
   location tracker manufacturers, which will allow for their
   compatibility with unwanted tracking detection and alerting
   technology on platforms.

   *  The term platform is used to refer to mobile device hardware and
      associated operating system.  Examples of mobile devices are
      phones, tablets, laptops, etc.

   *  The term accessory is used to refer to any product intended to
      interface with a platform through the means described in this
      specification.

   *  The term owner device is a device that is associated with the
      accessory and can retrieve the accessory’s location.

   *  The term non-owner device refers to a device that may connect to
      an accessory but is not an owner device of that accessory.

   *  The term location-tracking accessory refers to any accessory that
      has location-tracking capabilities, including, but not limited to,
      crowd-sourced location, GPS/GNSS location, WiFi location, cell
      location, etc., and provides the location information back to the
      owner of the accessory via the internet, cellular connection, etc.

   *  The term location-enabled state refers to the state an accessory
      in where its location can be remotely viewed by its owner

   *  The term location-enabled advertisement payload refers to the
      Bluetooth (BT) advertisement payload that is advertised when an
      accessory has recently, is currently, or will in the future
      provide location updates to its owner

   *  The term unwanted tracking (UT) refers to undesired tracking of a
      person, their property, or their belongings by a location-enabled
      accessory.

      person over time.

   *  The term unwanted tracking alert refers to notifying the user of
      the presence of an unrecognized accessory that may be traveling
      with them over time and allows them to take various actions,
      including playing a sound on the accessory if it’s in Bluetooth
      Low Energy (LE) range.

   *  The term platform-compatible method refers to a method of
      communication between the platform and the accessory/accessory
      manufacturers to exchange information, including, but not limited
      to, BT GATT protocol, BT advertisement, HTTP, etc.

2.  Background

2.1.  Applicability

   These best practices are REQUIRED for location-enabled accessories
   that are small and not easily discoverable.  For large accessories,
   such as a bicycle, these best practices are RECOMMENDED.

   Accessories are considered easily discoverable if they meet one of
   the following criteria:

   *  The item is larger than 30 cm in at least one dimension.

   *  The item is larger than 18 cm x 13 cm in two of its dimensions.

   *  The item is larger than 250 cm^3 in three-dimensional space.

3.  Requirements

3.1.  Overview

   This section details requirements and recommendations for best
   practices for location-enabled accessory manufacturers to allow
   unwanted tracking detection by platform makers.

3.2.  Bluetooth Low Energy

   The accessory SHALL use Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) as the transport
   protocol.  This enables platforms to detect and connect to
   accessories.

3.2.1.  Advertising

   The accessory SHALL advertise using Bluetooth LE.

3.2.2.  Connection

   The accessory MUST support at least one non-owner unencrypted
   connection in a peripheral role.  The connection interval of the
   Bluetooth LE link between the device and accessory MAY depend on the
   type of user interaction.  Non-owner connections to the accessory
   SHALL be implemented using a platform-compatible method, e.g., BT
   GATT service.

3.3.  Location Tracking

   The location-enabled accessory has location capabilities via
   Bluetooth crowd-sourcing, GPS/GNSS location, WiFi location, cellular
   location, or by some other means.  Furthermore, the accessory has a
   way to communicate its location to its owner via a network (e.g.,
   cell network, crowd-sourced location via Bluetooth, etc.).

   The accessory SHALL maintain an internal state that detects when its
   location is, or has been, available to the owner via a network.  This
   state is called the location-enabled state.

   Misuse of location-enabled accessories can occur when the owner’s
   device is not physically with the accessory.  Thereby, the accessory
   SHOULD maintain a second internal state, denoted the near-owner
   state, which indicates if the accessory is connected to or nearby one
   or more of the owner’s devices.  Near-owner state can take on two
   values, either near-owner mode or separated mode.  Near-owner mode is
   denoted as the opposite of separated mode.

   Figure 1 details the requirements and recommendations for advertising
   the location-enabled payload based on the location-enabled state and
   separated state.

                            +---------------------+
                            |      Location       |
                            |  Currently Enabled  |
                            |         OR          |
                            |  Enabled in Past 24 |
                            |        Hours        |
       +--------------------+---------------------|
       |         near-owner |        MAY          |
       |            mode    | advertise location- |
       | Near-              |  enabled payload    |
       | Owner              +---------------------|
       | State    separated |   MUST advertise    |
       |            mode    |  location-enabled   |
       |                    |     payload         |
       +--------------------+---------------------+

          Figure 1: Requirements & Recommendations For Advertising
                          Location-Enabled Payload

   If the accessory maker chooses to continue advertising the location-
   enabled payload while in near-owner mode, setting the near-owner bit
   (Section 3.8) compensates for this.

3.4.  Location-enabled Bluetooth LE Advertisement Payload

3.4.1.  Overview

   When in location-enabled state, the accessory SHALL advertise a
   Bluetooth LE format, denoted the location-enabled Bluetooth
   advertisement payload, that is recognizable to the platforms.

3.4.2.  Location-enabled advertisement payload format

   The payload format is defined in Table 1

      +=======+======================================+=============+
      | Bytes | Description                          | Requirement |
      +=======+======================================+=============+
      |  0-5  | MAC address                          |   REQUIRED  |
      +-------+--------------------------------------+-------------+
      |  6-8  | Flags TLV; length = 1 byte, type = 1 |   OPTIONAL  |
      |       | byte, value = 1 byte                 |             |
      +-------+--------------------------------------+-------------+
      |  9-12 | Service Data TLV; length = 1 byte,   |   REQUIRED  |
      |       | type = 0x16, value = 0xFCB2          |             |
      +-------+--------------------------------------+-------------+
      |   13  | Network ID                           |   REQUIRED  |
      +-------+--------------------------------------+-------------+
      |   14  | Near-owner bit (1 bit, least         |   REQUIRED  |
      |       | significant bit) + reserved (7 bits) |             |
      +-------+--------------------------------------+-------------+
      | 15-36 | Proprietary company payload data     |   OPTIONAL  |
      +-------+--------------------------------------+-------------+

                 Table 1: Location-Enabled Payload Format

   When Flags TLV are not added, the MAC address type needs to be set to
   random.  This implies that if Bluetooth LE pairing is supported, the
   accessory SHALL NOT use its public address as its public identity
   when exchanging pairing keys at phase 3 (see Vol.3, Part H,
   Section 2.1 of the [BTCore5.4]) and it SHALL only use a static random
   address.  Additionally, the LE advertisement needs to be connectable
   to allow for non-owner unencrypted connections to the accessory.
   Further details are discussed in Section 3.10.

   Proprietary company payload data is both OPTIONAL and variable
   length.

3.4.3.  Duration of advertising location-enabled advertisement payload

   The accessory SHALL broadcast the location-enabled advertisement
   payload if location is available to the owner or was available any
   time within the past 24 hours.  This allows unwanted tracking
   detection to operate both between and beyond the specific moments an
   accessory's location is made available to the owner.

3.4.4.  Maximum duration after physical separation from owner to
        transition into separated mode

   The accessory SHALL transition from near-owner mode to separated mode
   under the conditions listed in Table 2 below.

      +======================+=====================================+
      | Preferred            |              Acceptable             |
      +======================+=====================================+
      | The accessory has    |  The accessory has been physically  |
      | been physically      | separated from the owner device for |
      | separated from the   |    more than 30 minutes *AND* The   |
      | owner device for     | owner of the accessory has received |
      | more than 30 minutes |  a more recent location update for  |
      |                      |   that accessory after 30 minutes   |
      +----------------------+-------------------------------------+

                       Table 2: Advertising Policy

3.4.5.  Maximum duration after reunification with owner to transition
        into near-owner mode

   The accessory SHALL transition from separated to near-owner mode if
   it has reunited with the owner device for a duration no longer than
   30 minutes.

3.5.  MAC address

   The Bluetooth LE advertisement payload SHALL contain an address in
   the 6-byte Bluetooth MAC address field which looks random to all
   parties while being recognizable by the owner device.  The address
   type SHALL be set as a non-resolvable private address or as a static
   device address, as defined in Random Device Address in Vol 6, Part B,
   Section 1.3.2 of the [BTCore5.4].

   The owner MUST be able to predict the MAC address or the payload
   advertised by the accessory at any given time in order to suppress
   unwanted tracking alerts caused by a device’s owned accessory.  See
   Owned Accessory Identification (Section 6.1) for additional details.

   The address SHALL rotate periodically (see Rotation policy
   (Section 3.5.1)); otherwise if the same address is used for long
   periods of time, an adversary may be able to track a legitimate
   person carrying the accessory through local Bluetooth LE scanning
   devices.  Same rules apply to any other identifiable content of the
   advertised payload.

   A general approach to generate addresses meeting this requirement
   these properties is to construct them using a Pseudo-Random Function
   (PRF) taking as input a key established during the association of the
   accessory and either a counter or coarse notion of time.  The counter
   or coarse notion of time allows for the address to change
   periodically.  The key allows the owner devices to predict the
   sequence of addresses for the purposes of recognizing its associated
   accessories.

   This construction allows accessories to define their own MAC address
   generation process while also providing a means to meet the
   requirements for owned accessory identification (Section 6.1).

3.5.1.  Rotation policy

   An accessory SHALL rotate its address on any transition from near-
   owner state to separated state as well as any transition from
   separated state to near-owner state.

   When in near-owner state, the accessory SHALL rotate its address
   every 15 minutes.  This is a privacy consideration to deter tracking
   of the accessory by non-owners when it is in physical proximity to
   the owner.

   When in a separated state, the accessory SHALL rotate its address
   every 24 hours.  This duration allows a platform's unwanted tracking
   algorithms to detect that the same accessory is in proximity for some
   period of time, when the owner is not in physical proximity.

3.6.  Service data TLV

   The Service data TLV with a 2-byte UUID value of 0xFCB2 provides a
   way for platforms to easily scan for and detect the location-enabled
   Bluetooth advertisement.

3.7.  Network ID

   The 1-byte Network ID SHALL be set based on a registered value for
   the manufacturer, as defined in Manufacturer Network ID Registry
   (Section 10.1).

3.8.  Near-owner bit

   It is important to prevent unwanted tracking alerts from occurring
   when the owner of the accessory is in physical proximity of the
   accessory, i.e., it is in near-owner mode.  In order to allow
   suppression of unwanted tracking alerts for an accessory advertising
   the location-enabled advertisement with the owner nearby, the
   accessory MUST set the near-owner bit to be 1 when the near-owner
   state is in near-owner mode, otherwise the bit is set to 0.  Table 3
   specifies the values of this bit.

   The near-owner bit MUST be the least significant bit.

                +======================+==================+
                | Near-owner Bit Value | Near-owner state |
                +======================+==================+
                | 1                    | Near-owner mode  |
                +----------------------+------------------+
                | 0                    | Separated mode   |
                +----------------------+------------------+

                          Table 3: Near-Owner Bit

3.9.  Bluetooth LE advertising interval

   The detection rate performance has a dependency on the BLE
   advertising interval used. A maximum advertising interval of 4
   seconds SHALL be used; for the best detection rate, the advertising
   interval SHOULD be less than or equal to 2 seconds.

3.10.  Accessory Connections

   The accessory non-owner service UUID SHALL be 15190001-12F4-C226-
   88ED-2AC5579F2A85.  This service SHALL use GATT over LE.  The non-
   owner accessory service SHALL be instantiated as a primary service.
   The accessory non-owner characteristic UUID SHALL be
   8E0C0001-1D68-FB92-BF61-48377421680E.

3.10.1.  Byte transmission order

   The characteristic used within this service SHALL be transmitted with
   the least significant octet first (that is, little endian).

3.10.2.  Maximum transmission unit

   Data fragmentation and reassembly is not defined in this document;
   therefore, the accessory SHALL NOT request an MTU (Maximum
   Transmission Unit) smaller than the maximum length of its write
   responses for the opcodes defined in Non-owner controls
   (Section 3.12.4) and Section 3.11.1.  In other words, all opcode
   response data must fit within a single write operation.

3.11.  Accessory Information

   The following accessory information MUST be persistent through the
   lifetime of the accessory: Product data (Section 3.11.1.1),
   Manufacturer name (Section 3.11.1.2), Model name (Section 3.11.1.3),
   Accessory category (Section 3.11.1.4), Accessory capabilities
   (Section 3.11.1.6), Network ID (Section 3.7), and Battery Type
   (Section 3.11.1.9).

3.11.1.  Opcodes

   The opcodes for accessory information are defined in Table 4.

   *  <z> is the revision version number, required if non zero.

   The firmware revision MUST follow these rules:

   *  <x> is incremented when there is significant change; for example,
      1.0.0, 2.0.0, 3.0.0, and so on.

   *  <y> is incremented when minor changes are introduced, such as
      1.1.0, 2.1.0, 3.1.0, and so on.

   *  <z> is incremented when bug fixes are introduced, such as 1.0.1,
      2.0.1, 3.0.1, and so on.

   *  Subsequent firmware updates can have a lower <y> version only if
      <x> is incremented.

   *  Subsequent firmware updates can have a lower <z> version only if
      <x> or <y> is incremented.

   Major version MUST not be greater than (2^16 - 1).  Minor and
   revision version MUST not be greater than (2^8 - 1).  The value MUST
   change after every firmware update.

3.12.  Non-Owner Finding

   Once a user has been notified of an unknown accessory traveling with
   them, it is REQUIRED they have the means to physically locate the
   accessory.  This is called non-owner finding of the accessory.

3.12.1.  Hardware

   This is a description of the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED hardware to be
   incorporated into the accessory to enable non-owner finding.

3.12.2.  Motion detector

   The accessory SHOULD include a motion detector that can detect
   accessory motion reliably (for example, an accelerometer).  If the
   accessory includes an accelerometer, it MUST be configured to detect
   an orientation change of ±10° along any two axes of the accessory.

3.12.2.1.  Implementation

   The details in this section apply to those accessories that include a
   motion detector.  Values of the variables referenced are specified in
   Table 16.


   After T_(SEPARATED_UT_TIMEOUT) in separated state, the accessory MUST
   enable the motion detector to detect any motion within
   T_(SEPARATED_UT_SAMPLING_RATE1).

   If motion is not detected within the T_(SEPARATED_UT_SAMPLING_RATE1)
   period, the accessory MUST stay in this state until it exits
   separated state.

   If motion is detected within the T_(SEPARATED_UT_SAMPLING_RATE1) the
   accessory MUST play a sound.  After first motion is detected, the
   movement detection period is decreased to
   T_(SEPARATED_UT_SAMPLING_RATE2).  The accessory MUST continue to play
   a sound for every detected motion.  The accessory SHALL disable the
   motion detector for T_(SEPARATED_UT_BACKOFF) under either of the
   following conditions:

   *  Motion has been detected for 20 seconds at
      T_(SEPARATED_UT_SAMPLING_RATE2) periods.

   *  Ten sounds are played.

   If the accessory is still in separated state at the end of
   T_(SEPARATED_UT_BACKOFF), the UT behavior MUST restart.

   A Bluetooth LE connection from an associated device MUST reset the
   separated behavior.

3.12.3.  Sound maker

   The accessory MUST include a sound maker (for example, a speaker) to
   play sound when in separated state, either periodically or when
   motion is detected.

   It MUST also play sound when a non-owner tries to locate the
   accessory by initiating a play sound command from a non-owner device
   when the accessory is in range and connectable through Bluetooth LE.
   The sound maker MUST emit a sound with minimum 60 Phon peak loudness
   as defined by ISO 532-1:2017.  The loudness MUST be measured in free
   acoustic space substantially free of obstacles that would affect the
   pressure measurement.  The loudness MUST be measured by a calibrated
   (to the Pascal) free field microphone 25 cm from the accessory
   suspended in free space.

3.12.4.  Non-owner controls

   Non-owner controls SHALL use the same service and characteristic
   UUIDs as defined in Accessory Connections (Section 3.10).

   These controls allow a non-owner to locate the accessory by playing a
   sound as well as fetch an encrypted payload used to retrieve the
   identifier of the device.

   These opcodes are defined in Table 17.

                    Table 17: Non-Owner Controls Opcodes

   Sound_Start and Sound_Stop SHALL only be available to the platform
   when the accessory is in the separated state.

   In all other states, the accessory SHALL return the Invalid_command
   error as the ResponseStatus in Command_Response.

   Get_Identifier SHALL only be available when in identifier read state;
   otherwise, it MUST send Command_Response (Section 3.12.4.1.1) with
   the Invalid_command as the ResponseStatus.

   The identifier read state is discussed further in Identifier Payload
   (Section 3.12.4.2).

3.12.4.1.  Play sound

   The Sound_Start opcode is used to play sound on the sound maker of
   the accessory.  The sound maker MUST play sound for a minimum
   duration of 5 seconds.

   *  The accessory SHALL confirm the start of the play sound procedure
      by sending a Command_Response (Section 3.12.4.1.1) with the
      corresponding CommandOpCode and a ResponseStatus value of Success.

   *  Once the play sound action is completed, the accessory sends the
      Sound_Completed message.

   *  The Sound_Stop opcode is used to stop an ongoing sound request.

   *  If the sound event is completed or was not initiated by the
      connected non-owner device, the accessory responds with the
      Invalid_state ResponseStatus code.

   *  If the accessory does not support the play sound procedure, it
      responds with Invalid_command ResponseStatus code.

   *  If a Sound_Start procedure is initiated when another play sound
      action is in progress, it rejects with Invalid_state error code.

   *  The accessory SHALL confirm the completion of the stop sound
      procedure by sending the Sound_Completed message.

3.12.4.1.1.  Command Response

   There are 2 components of the command response operands:
   CommandOpCode and ResponseStatus.  The CommandOpCode operand
   indicates the procedure that the accessory is responding to and
   ResponseStatus operand indicates the status of the response.  The
   accessory SHALL respond to any invalid opcode with Command_Response
   and Invalid_command as the ResponseStatus.

3.12.4.2.  Identifier Payload

   The Get_Identifier opcode is used to retrieve identifier lookup
   payload over Bluetooth LE.  To enable this opcode, the accessory MUST
   be in the identifier read state.  To enter the identifier read state,
   a user action on the accessory MUST be performed (for example, press
   and hold a button for 10 seconds).  The identifier read state MUST be
   enabled for 5 minutes once the user action on the accessory is
   successfully performed.  When the accessory is in this mode, it MUST
   respond with Get_Identifier_Response opcode and Identifier Payload
   operand.

    +------------+-------+------------+------------+------------------+

                Table 19: Identifier Payload Over Bluetooth

   It is REQUIRED that the encrypted identifier (which in some cases is
   the product serial number) be non-identifiable.

   If the accessory is not in identifier read state, it MUST send
   Command_Response (Section 3.12.4.1.1) with the Invalid_command as the
   ResponseStatus.  Further considerations for how these operands should
   be implemented are discussed in Design of encrypted identifier
   look-up (Section 8.1.1).

3.12.5.  Alternate finding hardware

   The accessory SHOULD provide alternate means to help find it, e.g. by
   vibrating or flashing lights, via a platform-compatible method.
   Future versions of this document will consider support for haptics
   and lights.

3.12.6.  Recommended Finding Options

   Table 20 lists two RECOMMENDED options on the set of technology in an
   accessory to make it findable.

3.12.7.  Future hardware

   Future technologies for finding MAY be considered in revisions of
   this document.

3.13.  Disablement

   The accessory SHALL have a way to be disabled such that its future
   locations cannot be seen by its owner.  Disablement SHALL be done via
   some physical action (e.g., button press, gesture, removal of
   battery, etc.).

3.13.1.  Disablement instructions

   The accessory manufacturer SHALL provide both a text description of
   how to disable the accessory as well as a visual depiction (e.g.
   image, diagram, animation, etc.) that MUST be available when the
   platform is online and OPTIONALLY when offline.  Disablement
   procedure or instructions CAN change with accessory firmware updates.
   These are provided as part of the onboarding process (Section 7).

3.14.  Identification

   The accessory MUST include a way to uniquely identify it - either via
   a serial number or other privacy-preserving solution.  Guidelines for
   serial numbers only apply if the accessory supports identification
   via a serial number.

3.14.1.  Serial number identification

   If a serial number is available, it SHALL be printed and be easily
   accessible on the accessory.  The serial number MUST be unique for
   each product ID.

3.14.2.  Identifier retrieval capability

   The identifier payload SHALL be readable either through NFC tap (see
   Identifier over NFC (Section 3.14.5)) or Bluetooth LE (see Identifier
   Retrieval over Bluetooth LE (Section 3.14.3) ).

3.14.3.  Identifier retrieval over Bluetooth LE

   For privacy reasons, accessories that support identifier retrieval
   for identifiers not included in the advertising packet over Bluetooth
   LE MUST have a physical mechanism, for example, a button, that SHALL
   be required to enable the Get_Identifier opcode, as discussed in
   Identifier Payload (Section 3.12.4.2).

   The accessory manufacturer SHALL provide both a text description of
   how to enable identifier retrieval over Bluetooth LE, as well as a
   visual depiction (e.g. image, diagram, animation, etc.) that MUST be
   available when the platform is online and OPTIONALLY when offline.
   The description and visual depiction CAN change with accessory
   firmware updates.  These are provided as part of the onboarding
   process (Section 7).

3.14.4.  Identifier retrieval from a server

   For security reasons, the identifier payload returned from an
   accessory in the paired state SHALL be encrypted.

3.14.5.  Identifier over NFC

   For those accessories that support identifier retrieval over NFC, an
   associated accessory SHALL advertise the encrypted identifier encoded
   as a hex string.  This string SHALL be an argument passed to the URL
   defined in the Product data registry (product-data-registry) which
   SHALL decrypt the identifier payload and return the identifier of the
   accessory in a form that can be rendered in the platform's HTML view.

   The encrypted identifier when in associated state SHALL be an
   argument passed to this URL and it is REQUIRED that any metadata
   passed be non-identifiable.

3.15.  Owner registry

   Verifiable identity information of the owner of an accessory at time
   of association SHALL be recorded and associated with the identifier
   of the accessory, e.g., phone number, email address.

3.15.1.  Obfuscated owner information

   A limited amount of obfuscated owner information from the owner
   registry SHALL be made available to the platform along with a
   retrieved identifier (identifier-retrieval).  This information SHALL
   be part of the response of the identifier retrieval from a server
   (identifier-from-server) which can be rendered in a platform's HTML
   view.

   This MUST include at least one of the following:

   *  the last four digits of the owner's telephone number. e.g., (***)
      ***-5555

   *  an email address with the first letter of the username and entity
      visible, as well as the entire extension. e.g.,
      b********@i*****.com

3.15.2.  Persistence

   The owner registry SHOULD be stored for a minimum of 25 days after an
   owner has unassociated an accessory.  After the elapsed period, the
   data SHOULD be deleted.

3.15.3.  Availability for law enforcement

   Available ownership registry information SHOULD be produced in
   response to a valid law enforcement request seeking information
   related to the misuse of location-tracking accessories provided that
   the request is submitted pursuant to defined procedures for obtaining
   such information.  Network providers SHOULD define their own
   procedures for submission of valid legal requests from law
   enforcement.

4.  Accessory Category Value

   Accessory manufacturer’s MUST pick an accessory category value that
   closest resembles their physical product.  If none of the accessory
   categories provided in Table 21 match the physical product, Other
   MUST be chosen.

                   Table 21: Accessory Category Values

5.  Firmware Updates

   The accessory SHOULD have a mechanism for the manufacturer to provide
   firmware updates.

5.1.  Backwards Compatibility

5.1.1.  Existing trackers

   Existing trackers should be updated on a best-effort basis to
   implement the protocols and practices outlined above.

5.1.2.  Advertisement backwards compatibility

   The manufacturer MAY continue to use the company’s existing service
   UUID (Legacy ID) as registered in the Bluetooth SIG until November 1,
   2024, after which all manufacturers MUST use the unwanted tracking
   service UUID to be detected for unwanted tracking.  Trackers that use
   the company's Legacy ID MUST be able to have their firmware updated.
   This applies to new or updated trackers and any existing trackers
   that have the ability to have their firmware updated.

   If the manufacturer wishes to use their Legacy ID, the Legacy ID MUST
   be registered with platforms.  If a manufacturer is using a Legacy
   ID, Network ID in Table 1 MAY be omitted.

   Manufacturers can register their service UUID by reaching out to the
   listed authors.  Backwards compatibility requests must be submitted
   by January 15, 2024.  Manufacturers who have registered their Network
   IDs will appear in a table below.

   If using existing service UUIDs, rather than the unwanted tracking
   protocol UUID, detection performance might be degraded.

6.  Platform Support for Unwanted Tracking

   This section details the requirements and recommendations for
   platforms to be compatible with the accessory protocol behavior
   described in the document.

6.1.  Owned Accessory Identification

   Any platform that supports unwanted tracking SHOULD also provide the
   capability to suppress unwanted tracking alerts caused by an
   accessory associated with the owner device.

   If an unwanted tracking alert occurs for an accessory and the
   platform does not already have the installed capability to prevent
   this alert for the owner of the accessory, then the platform SHOULD
   explain to the user how those capabilities can be acquired.

6.1.1.  Implementation

   Unwanted tracking SHOULD recognize an accessory associated to that
   owner device by matching the MAC address advertised as defined in
   Table 1, or some other part of the payload, against the one(s)
   expected during that time.

6.1.2.  Platform Software Extension

   Platforms SHOULD implement the owned accessory identification
   capability as a software extension to its unwanted tracking
   detection.

   Accessory manufacturers SHALL provide this set of MAC addresses or
   matching rules to the platform.  This set MUST account for the
   uncertainty involved with the MAC address (Section 3.5).

   The Network ID in the advertisement payload, as specified in Table 1,
   SHALL be used to associate an accessory detected with the
   manufacturer's software extension.

6.1.3.  Network Access

   Network access MUST NOT be required in the moment that the platform
   performs owned accessory recognition.

6.1.4.  Removal

   The platform MUST delete any local identifying information associated
   with an accessory if the manufacturer's software is removed or if the
   platform unassociates from the accessory.

7.  Onboarding

   Accessory manufacturers MUST follow a minimum set of steps for their
   accessories to be detectable by platforms such as adding their
   Network ID value to the Manufacturer network ID Registry
   (Section 10.1).

   During onboarding, a product data registry will be created that
   includes information such as:

   *  Product Data: an 8-byte string representing a unique identifier
      for a product.  See Product Data (Section 3.11.1.1).

   *  Disablement Instructions: information on how a user can disable
      the tracker.

   *  Identifier Look-up Over Bluetooth Instructions: visual depictions
      for enabling identifier look-up over Bluetooth LE.

   *  Identifier Look-up: a method to retrieve the obfuscated owner
      information and possibly identifier.

   *  Product Name: a string representing the accessory make and model
      associated with the Product Data string.

   Additional details will follow in 2024 to specify formats for
   disablement instructions and product images.

7.1.  Network providers

   Companies that have their own accessory-locating networks will need
   to create infrastructure to support the scaled retrieval of
   disablement instructions and product images.  Additional information
   for network providers will be updated in 2024.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Obfuscated owner information look-up

   Obfuscated owner information look-up is required to display important
   information to users who encounter an unwanted tracking notification.
   It helps them tie the notification to a specific physical device and
   recognize the accessory as belonging to a friend or relative.
   Displaying an identifier (or serial number) may be one method to
   allow for partial user information look up.

   However, the identifier is unique and stable, and the partial user
   information can further make the accessory identifiable.  Therefore,
   identifier (if used) and obfuscated owner information SHOULD NOT be
   made directly available to any requesting devices.  Instead, several
   security- and privacy-preserving steps SHOULD be employed.

   The obfuscated owner information and identifier look-up SHALL only be
   available in separated mode for an associated accessory.  When
   requested through any long range wireless interface like Bluetooth, a
   user action MUST be required for the requesting device to access the
   obfuscated owner information and identifier.  Over NFC, it MAY be
   acceptable to consider the close proximity as intent for this flow.

   To uphold privacy and anti-tracking features like the Bluetooth MAC
   address randomization, the accessory MUST only provide non-
   identifiable data to non-owner requesting devices.  One approach is
   for the accessory to provide encrypted and unlinkable information
   that only the accessory network service can decrypt.  With this
   approach, the server can employ techniques such as rate limiting and
   anti-fraud to limit access to the identifier.  In addition to being
   encrypted and unlinkable, the encrypted payload provided by the
   accessory SHOULD be authenticated and protected against replay.  The
   replay protection is to prevent an adversary using a payload captured
   once to monitor changes to the partial information associated with
   the accessory, while the authentication prevents an adversary from
   impersonating any accessory from a single payload.

8.1.1.  Design of encrypted identifier look-up

   One way to design this encryption is for the accessory to contain a
   public key for the accessory network server.  For every request
   received by a device nearby, the accessory would use the public key
   and a public key encryption scheme (ie: RSA-OAEP, ECIES, or HPKE) to
   encrypt a set of fields including the identifier, a monotonic counter
   or one time token and a signature covering both the identifier and
   counter or token.  The signature can be either a public key signature
   or symmetric signature, leveraging a key trusted by the network
   server which MAY be established at manufacturing time or when the
   user sets up the accessory.  Some additional non-identifiable
   metadata MAY be sent along with this encrypted payload, allowing the
   requesting device to determine which accessory network service to
   connect to for the decryption, and for the service to know which
   decryption key and protocol version to use.

9.  Privacy Considerations

9.1.  Obfuscated owner information

   In many circumstances when unwanted tracking occurs, the individual
   being tracked knows the owner of the location-tracker.  By allowing
   the retrieval of an obfuscated email or phone number when in
   possession of the accessory, as described in Section 3.15.1, this
   provides the potential victim with some level of information on the
   owner, while balancing the privacy of accessory owners in the
   arbitrary situations where they have separated from those
   accessories.

9.2.  Identifier look-up

   An identifier both physically on the device, as well as retrievable
   over NFC or Bluetooth LE, can aid recourse actions in the case of
   unwanted tracking.  While retrieval of the identifier over NFC
   implies having physical possession of the accessory, the same
   conclusion can not be made for Bluetooth given its wireless range.
   The procedure required for identifier look-up over Bluetooth LE
   intends to strike a balance between the privacy of the owner and
   ability to empower potential victims, by requiring both the accessory
   to be in separated state as well as a physical action be performed to
   enable the identifier retrieval.

9.3.  Location-enabled payload

9.3.1.  Stable identifiers

   Rotating the mac address of the location-enabled payload, as
   described in Section 3.5, balances the risk of nefarious stable
   identifier tracking with the need for unwanted tracking detection.
   If the address were permanently static, then the accessory would
   become infinitely trackable for the life of its power source.  By
   requiring rotation, this reduces the risk of a malicious actor having
   the ability to piece together long stretches of longitudinal data on
   the whereabouts of an accessory.

9.3.2.  Proprietary company payload data

   Accessory manufacturers SHOULD evaluate the contents of the
   proprietary company payload data in Table 1 to ensure it does not
   introduce additional privacy risk through the broadcast of stable
   identifiers or unencrypted sensitive data.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Eventually an IANA will create a new registry group called "Unwanted
   Tracking Protocols (UTP)".  This group includes the "Manufacturer
   Network ID" registry.

10.1.  Manufacturer Network ID Registry

   New entries are assigned only for values that have received Expert
   Review, per Section 4.5 of [RFC8126].

   An entry in this registry contains the following fields:

   *  Manufacturer Name: the name of an organization that is producing a
      location-tracker accessory

   *  Network ID: a 1-byte value specifying the Network ID associated
      with the Manufacturer Name

10.1.1.  Temporary Registry

   Until this an IANA registry is available, the values in this registry
   are listed in Table 22.

                       +============+==============+
                       | Network ID | Manufacturer |
                       +============+==============+
                       |    0x00    |   Reserved   |
                       +------------+--------------+
                       |    0x01    |  Apple Inc.  |
                       +------------+--------------+
                       |    0x02    |  Google LLC  |
                       +------------+--------------+
                       |    0xFF    |   Reserved   |
                       +------------+--------------+
