This specification does not make it easier to discover these trackers for thieves. AirTags, Samsung Trackers, Tile, they all rely on Bluetooth. Every simple Bluetooth scanner app can find them. \r\n\r\nThe intended use-case was to find your lost valuables and that's where these devices are great at. The added protection against stalking is helpful for people who are in threat of stalking. Stalking can lead to harmful attacks and have already ended up in at least two people getting killed after they have been tracked with an AirTag. The value of any material device should never be higher than the value of human life. ",

There are ways to keep the main focus on fixing unwanted tracking, while addressing theft protection as well.\r\n\r\nA naive approach I've suggested in the comments above is for OEMs to keep track of device IDs used to disable tracking, and have those available to authorities, in case a tracker is reported as stolen / attached to a stolen item.

There is no way for my Android phone to inform Apple that I've disabled tracking on the AirTag. IMO, there are also negative privacy implications for these platforms to start storing device IDs, especially since this spec is in the context of reducing unwanted tracking.\r\n\r\nFurther, as far as I can tell, disablement is currently only defined as a physical action, so there is no actual way to figure out which person/device has physically disabled the tracker. The spec would need to define a way to disable an unwanted tracker through bluetooth.",

The threat from \"finder\" type location trackers like\r\nTiles or AirTags comes from the interaction of a number of features,\r\nspecifically:\r\n\r\n1. They are compact (thus easy to hide)\r\n2. They are cheap (thus easy to obtain)\r\n3. They take advantage of a preexisting infrastructure intended\r\n   for another purpose (the finder network)\r\n4. They have long battery lifetimes (and thus are suitable\r\n   for long-term surveillance)\r\n\r\nTo contextualize this, consider the counter example of a GPS tracker\r\nlike a Garmin inReach, which takes a GPS location and broadcasts it to\r\na satellite. These cost about $300, have battery life measured in days,\r\nand are several centimeters across, so are hard to conceal. This is\r\nmuch less useful for both covert surveillance and for finding ones\r\nown items. So, the objective of this work should be to the extent\r\npossible to prevent attacks which are cheaper than buying your\r\nown GPS tracker.\u201d",

There are several attacks here,\r\nincluding:\r\n\r\n1. Modifying an existing tage to make it nonconformant in\r\n   such a way that the countermeasures in this draft don't\r\n   work.\r\n2. Making a new tag which is nonconformant, etc.\r\n\r\nI think this framing is useful when considering two different sets\r\nof countermeasures in this design:\r\n\r\n1. The \"sound maker\" feature of having the device make noise when its\r\n   separated and moving (S 3.12.2.1) or when it is located\r\n   (S 3.12.3).\r\n\r\n2. The BT-based \"this device is following me\" feature described in\r\n   S 3.4.3.\r\n\r\nThe key point I would like to make here is that countermeasure\r\n(1) is potentially evaded without compromising the above invariants.\r\nFor instance, maybe I can take an AirTag and disable the speaker\r\nin some way but it will still work for location tracking. Or\r\nmaybe I can wrap it in some sound insulating material. Clearly I\r\ncan fix the flashing lights. None of this seems like it impacts\r\nthe basic tracking functionality, including the surveillance\r\nuse case.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, I don't think it's necessarily feasible to easily modify\r\nthe tracker to use some different protocol that would still be\r\ncompatible with tracking but harder to detect (e.g., faster ID rotation)\r\nbecause that would depend on changing the firmware. So that is\r\na harder attack to mount, especially if the firmware is signed.\r\nObviously you can burn out the radio or wrap it in a faraday cage,\r\nbut that breaks *both* tracking and unwanted tracking detection.\r\nHowever, it might be able to build a fake tag which violated\r\nthese invariants.\r\n\r\nMy point here is that detection countermeasures need to depend\r\non properties of the system that are hard to subvert while\r\nhaving it continue to be functional. \u201c",

I was trying to find out if playing sounds should be possible when the accessory is in *near-owner* state, and I found Section 3.12.3 confusing.\r\n\r\nSection 3.12.3 \"Sound Maker\" currently reads:\r\n\r\n> The accessory MUST include a sound maker (for example, a speaker) to play sound ***when in separated state***, either periodically or when motion is detected.\r\n> It MUST ***also*** play sound when a non-owner tries to locate the accessory by initiating a play sound command from a non-owner device when the accessory is in range and connectable through Bluetooth LE.\r\n\r\nThis section initially gave me the impression that playing sounds is always possible when in-range (both near-owner and separated state), and it seemed to contradict the statement in 3.12.4. Perhaps the Sound Maker section could emphasise that non-owner initiated sounds require the separated state (\"when the accessory is in range and ~connectable through Bluetooth LE~ *in separated mode.*\")\r\n\r\nThis issue seems to be the right place to share my confusion :-)",

      "body": "Thanks for your work on this document, and for soliciting feedback.\r\n\r\nI did some research on Apple AirTags last year, and one of the things that surprised me was how difficult it was to detect an AirTag using a [standard bluetooth scanner](https://www.maggiedelano.com/2022/02/21/apple-airtags-active-scanning.html) on iOS. It was much easier on Android, and unless it has changed recently there is no way to actively scan for AirTags on iOS (although it was in a beta at some point?). There are many contexts where a user would prefer to be able to actively scan their environment for unwanted trackers, rather than relying on a passive notification (which can take hours to occur).\r\n\r\nI understand that platform issues are out of scope for this document, so I'll focus my other comments more specifically here too. Could the authors share the above concerns/suggestions with the relevant iOS team?\r\n\r\nThis document proposes an advertisement payload (section 3.4) that would allow \"platforms to easily scan for and detect the location-enabled Bluetooth advertisement\" (section 3.6). From what I can tell this is close to what AirTags already do. A few questions/comments:\r\n\r\n- Will the service data TLV be standardized across location trackers? (I'm assuming yes but part of that section is marked TODO)\r\n- It would be helpful to have some context on what existing location trackers already do and how/whether this is codification of what existing trackers e.g. AirTags already do, vs. a new proposed advertisement packet. I think the existing one works fine but the iOS platform is an issue for active scanning right now as I discuss above.\r\n- I think section 6 should encourage (if not require) platforms to support both active and passive scanning. There should also be some discussion about appropriate time frames for passive notification (getting notified hours later is not helpful, but at the same time false positives need to be avoided).\r\n",

These requirements are essential to providing the detection capability claimed by the specification. By hypothesis, trackers manufactured by \"legitimate\" vendors will be conformant and therefore detectable. The question I am trying to get at is whether it is possible to build a non-conformant tracker that will nevertheless be able to participate in the tracking system but is not detectable. That's what I meant by \"fake\" but hopefully this is a clearer statement.\r\n\r\nI'm distinguishing this from the question of modifying a \"legitimate\" tracker because one might imagine a system in which:\r\n\r\n1. Tracker vendors attested to conformance in some non-technical way\r\n2. There was a technical attestation that a given tracker was manufactured by one of the aforementioned vendors.\r\n3. That attestation was checked prior to letting that tracker participate in the network.\r\n\r\nThis would be intended to prevent other vendors from just making nonconformant trackers and having them accepted. In this case, it would be the \"legitimate\" vendor's responsibility to ensure that the tracker was hard to modify and if it were determined that it was easy to do so, that would be a vulnerability they should fix, but the protocol wouldn't engage with that other than, potentially blocklisting trackers of that model/vendor. I'm not saying this is a good system, as I prefer not to rely on trusted hardware; I just think it's a different threat.",

That's not a sufficient distinction for my headphones, though.  They need the support of crowd devices.  I would say that any device that does NOT require the support of crowd devices should be immediately out of scope; I don't think that's practical here.

If it replaces the MAC, then we should clarify the requirements on the MAC address.\r\n- Clarify the section 6.1.1. and 6.1.2. in \"owned accessory identification\u201d to include a length and offset for the matching when using data from the payload along describing the matching as a byte comparisons.\r\n- If the data in the payload replaces rather than augments the MAC comparison, we should have a requirement that the matching must be over 46bit minimum, so the probability of the platform of mis-categorizing an accessory as \u201cOwned\u201d remains low.

Nevertheless, there may exist different target groups that have different needs. For example, a police officer can be required to perform a detailed scan of the environment to detect any nearby trackers. It would be possible for a third-party developer to implement such a service and offer it on the App Store / Google Play Store. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, users might need more detailed settings.

This PR provides addresses the following:\r\n\r\n1. Disambiguate \"Pairing\" and use \"association\" instead where applicable (issue #17 ).\r\n2. Not require a given MAC address format (issue #18 ).\r\n3. When not in separated mode, require to rotate the MAC \"at least every 120 minutes\" instead of \"every 15 minutes\": the rational is that 120 should be good enough so we don't really need to require 15 minutes (of course 15 mn would be allowed).\r\n4. Make the \"Paired (Associated) Accessory Identification\" mandatory instead of optional for platforms to support: the rational is that the experience would be poor if this is not supported by platforms.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJosselin\r\n",

Disambiguate \"Pairing\" and use \"association\" instead where applicable (issue https://github.com/bdetwiler/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/issues/17 ).:_\r\n\r\nWe have modified the language in this draft to use 'associated' where applicable to reduce confusion with the word 'pairing' \r\n\r\n_2.) Not require a given MAC address format (issue https://github.com/bdetwiler/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/issues/18 )._\r\n\r\nWe have made updates to the mac address language, hopefully this addresses concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_3.) When not in separated mode, require to rotate the MAC \"at least every 120 minutes\" instead of \"every 15 minutes\": the rational is that 120 should be good enough so we don't really need to require 15 minutes (of course 15 mn would be allowed)._\r\n  \r\nSome information was shared on this Issue which explains why we are requiring 15min. https://github.com/bdetwiler/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/issues/33\r\n\r\n_4.) Make the \"Paired (Associated) Accessory Identification\" mandatory instead of optional for platforms to support: the rational is that the experience would be poor if this is not supported by platforms._\r\n\r\nTracking this here: https://github.com/bdetwiler/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/issues/34\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This protocol is intended to help protect people against being unknowingly tracked by allowing arbitrary devices to detect unwanted tracking by these accessories. The protocols and interactions between devices may be limited to certain states or modes, such as the accessory being separated from a paired/owner device.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is closer to the sense.",

Let me see if I can flesh out the intention here. \r\n\r\n- Standardize the protocols used by (1) the tag to communicate with finding devices (2) the tag to communicate with devices when apparent unwanted tracking is detected (e.g., to cause it to beep).\r\n- Not standardize the protocols use by the finding device to report to the tracking network (e.g., to upload to iCloud), the protocols used to initialize the tag, or the protocols used by the tag owner to query the network for location.\r\n\r\nOne way to phrase this is that it ought to be enough to allow you to build your own tag that would work with the network, assuming it had the right keying material. \r\n\r\nDoes that sound right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
